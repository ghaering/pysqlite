pysqlite
========

pysqlite is a Python DB-API module for SQLite 3.

It is available for Python 2.x.

Online documentation can be found [here](https://pysqlite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/sqlite3.html).

You can get help from the community on the Google Group [python-sqlite](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/).

Note: Python's standard-library built-in [`sqlite3` module](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Modules/_sqlite) is based on `pysqlite` (this project). However, they are maintained separately and they have slightly different APIs.
